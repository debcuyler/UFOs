# UFOs
   The Truth is Out There!!
   
## Overview
Dana is working on developing a portfolio and wants to showcase her interest in UFOs! She really wants to impress NASA so that someday she might land her dream job there. Dana has created a webpage with a dynamic table that allows users to filter the data for analysis of UFO sightings.

## Results
The webpage that we created can be filtered for the following criteria:
- Date

- City

- State

- Country

- Shape of Object Seen


Users will enter data, if the format shown by default, to search for specific details. The more parameters searched will result in a more narrow focus of data as all entered parameters must match for each row.

## Summary
 - One drawback of this webpage is that it is not apparent to the user how to clear the filters and search again. 
 - With further development, I would add a 'clear filters' button so the user can easily search again with new filters. I would also make the filter options as dropdowns so that the user does not need to figure out the exact syntax of the filter, they would merely select their option from a fixed dropdown list.
